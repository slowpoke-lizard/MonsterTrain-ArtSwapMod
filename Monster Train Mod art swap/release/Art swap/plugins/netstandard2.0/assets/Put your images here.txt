Put your alternate card art in this directory.
This will only affect card art, not the monster summoned or anything else.

Pictures can be in jpg or png format.
972 (width) x 1176 (height) Pixels is the resolution of the base game art. Use the same aspect ratio.

Filename for your art should match the English name of the card you wish to change.
Ex: use "Deadweight.jpg" to change the card art for Deadweight.
Please make sure the extension (jpg, png) is in lower case.
